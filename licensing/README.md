# Licensing

As part of gcloud launcher, we are required to put a copy of all licenses
associated with dependent software components on the image.  This directory
is just keeping a copy of those licenses, which will be placed on the VM.

The google spreadsheet of what the dependent components was, was taken from
a vericode scan of the product, and can be found here:

As part of the open source license review process, we have to prove to google
reviewers that these are included on the VM.
